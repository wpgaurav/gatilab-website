# Gatilab — Brand Voice & Content Style Guide

**How we communicate across all channels**

---

## Our Voice in Three Words

**Direct. Expert. Results-focused.**

We speak like practitioners who've done the work, not marketers who've read about it. We're confident because we have the track record. We're honest because bullshit doesn't scale.

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. Lead with Outcomes, Not Features

Nobody cares about your process until they trust your results. Start with what changed, then explain how.

**Don't write:** "Our comprehensive SEO methodology incorporates technical audits, content optimization, and strategic link building."

**Write:** "Average client sees 47% traffic increase in 6 months. Here's the SEO approach that gets there."

### 2. Be Specific, Not Impressive

Vague claims sound like every other agency. Specific numbers build trust.

**Don't write:** "We've worked with numerous prestigious clients across various industries."

**Write:** "700+ clients. IBM, Adobe, HubSpot, Government of India. 330% combined revenue growth."

### 3. Own Your Opinions

We have 16+ years of experience. We've earned the right to have opinions. State them clearly.

**Don't write:** "Some businesses may find that WordPress offers certain advantages for their specific use cases."

**Write:** "WordPress powers 43% of the web for a reason. For most businesses, it's the right choice. Here's when it's not."

### 4. Respect the Reader's Time

Busy people hire us. Write like you're talking to someone billing $500/hour.

**Don't write:** "In the following comprehensive guide, we will explore the various aspects of conversion rate optimization and how it can potentially benefit your business."

**Write:** "CRO basics in 5 minutes. What to test first, what to ignore, and when to call for help."

## Words We Avoid

### Empty Marketing Speak
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing"
- "World-class" / "Best-in-class"
- "Innovative solutions"
- "Thought leadership"
- "Digital transformation"
- "Paradigm shift"

### Weasel Words
- "Up to X% improvement" (what's the average?)
- "Many clients" (how many?)
- "Significant results" (define significant)
- "Various industries" (which ones?)

### Overused Agency Phrases
- "We're passionate about..."
- "We believe in..."
- "Our team of experts..."
- "Your success is our success"
- "We treat every client like family"

---

## Writing About Our Work

### Do This
- Use specific numbers (47% traffic increase, not "significant growth")
- Name clients when permitted (IBM, Adobe, Government of India)
- Show before/after comparisons
- Acknowledge what didn't work and why
- Credit the client's role in success

### Don't Do This
- Claim credit for client's entire business success
- Use vague superlatives ("amazing results")
- Hide behind NDAs when you can anonymize
- Pretend every project was smooth sailing

### Example

**Good:** "E-commerce client's conversion rate went from 1.2% to 3.1% after checkout redesign. Took 6 weeks. Main change: reduced form fields from 12 to 5."

**Bad:** "We delivered a comprehensive e-commerce optimization strategy that resulted in significant conversion improvements for our valued client."

---

## Writing About Services

### Structure for Service Descriptions

1. **What it is** (one sentence, plain English)
2. **Who needs it** (specific situations)
3. **What you get** (deliverables)
4. **What it costs** (range or starting point)
5. **Proof it works** (result or client name)

### Example

**WordPress Development**

We build WordPress sites that load fast, convert visitors, and don't break when you update plugins.

Best for: Businesses outgrowing DIY sites, companies needing custom functionality, anyone tired of fighting their CMS.

What you get: Custom theme or carefully configured builder setup, performance optimization, security hardening, 30-day post-launch support.

Starting at: $3,500 for standard business sites. Complex builds quoted individually.

Track record: 200+ WordPress sites delivered. Average load time under 2 seconds.

---

## Handling Common Situations

### When Asked "Why Are You More Expensive?"

Don't apologize. Explain the difference.

"We charge more because we deliver more. Our sites load faster, convert better, and don't break. We use senior people, not juniors learning on your budget. If you need the cheapest option, we're not it. If you need results, let's talk."

### When Asked About Competitors

Never badmouth. Differentiate.

"I can't speak to how they work. Here's what we do differently: [specific differentiator]. The best way to compare is to see our portfolio and talk to our clients."

### When Delivering Bad News

Lead with it. Don't bury it.

"The timeline is slipping by two weeks. Here's why, here's what we're doing about it, and here's the revised schedule. Questions?"

### When a Project Isn't a Fit

Be honest early. It saves everyone time.

"Based on what you've described, we're probably not the right fit. You need [X], and our strength is [Y]. I'd recommend looking at [alternative]. If your needs change, we're here."

## Email Signature Standards

### Standard Signature
```
[Name]
[Role] | Gatilab
gatilab.com
```

### Extended Signature (for new contacts)
```
[Name]

```

## Social Media Guidelines

### LinkedIn Posts

**Good topics:**
- Specific lessons from client projects (anonymized if needed)
- Industry opinions with clear stance
- Behind-the-scenes of how we work
- Celebrating team and client wins

**Avoid:**
- Generic motivational content
- "Thought leadership" that says nothing
- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree!")
- Complaining about clients or industry

### Post Structure

1. Hook in first line (problem or surprising statement)
2. Context (2-3 sentences)
3. Insight or lesson (the actual value)
4. Single call-to-action if relevant

### Example Post

**Hook:** Most agency websites break their own conversion rules.

**Context:** Spent an hour reviewing 50 digital agency sites yesterday. Looking for inspiration for a client project.

**Insight:** 38 of them had no clear CTA above the fold. 27 had load times over 4 seconds. 19 didn't mention a single client result.

These are agencies selling conversion optimization.

**CTA:** (Optional) What's the worst "do as I say, not as I do" you've seen in our industry?

## Content Formatting Rules

### Paragraphs
- Keep them short (2-4 sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks generously

### Headings
- Clear and descriptive
- No clever wordplay that obscures meaning
- H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections

### Lists
- Use sparingly—prose is usually better
- When used, make items substantive
- Parallel structure across items

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for statistics and money

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing any content:

- [ ] Does this provide actual value or is it filler?
- [ ] Are claims specific and verifiable?
- [ ] Would I be embarrassed if a competitor read this?
- [ ] Is it shorter than it could be?
- [ ] Does it sound like us or like every other agency?
- [ ] Is there a clear next step for the reader?
