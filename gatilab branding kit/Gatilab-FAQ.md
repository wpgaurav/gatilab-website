Our core services: WordPress development, SEO, content marketing, web design, branding, and graphic design.

### How big is your team?

We have a core team of 14+ specialists including developers, designers, content writers, and SEO experts. We stay deliberately lean to maintain quality. No junior staff learning on your budget.

### Who are some of your clients?

## Working With Us

### How do I get started?

1. **Reach out:** Contact us via gatilab.com/connect or email contact@gatilab.com
2. **Discovery call:** 30-minute call to understand your needs
3. **Proposal:** Detailed scope, timeline, and pricing within 3-5 days
4. **Kickoff:** Once approved, we start with a kickoff meeting

### What's your typical project timeline?

| Project Type | Timeline |
|--------------|----------|
| Business website | 4-6 weeks |
| E-commerce site | 6-10 weeks |
| SEO (first results) | 3-4 months |
| Logo & branding | 2-4 weeks |
| Content piece | 5-7 business days |

Complex projects are scoped individually. We're honest about timelines—if we can't meet yours, we'll say so upfront.

### Do you work with small businesses or only enterprises?

Both. Our client roster ranges from solopreneurs to Government of India. What matters isn't your size—it's whether you value quality and have clear goals.

That said, we have project minimums. If you need a $500 website, we're not the right fit. We recommend Fiverr or template sites for very small budgets.

### What's your minimum project size?

- **Web development:** $3,500+
- **SEO retainer:** $800/month minimum
- **Content marketing:** $800/month minimum
- **Branding:** $500+
- **One-off design:** $200+

We price based on value delivered, not hours worked.

### Do you offer payment plans?

For larger projects (over $5,000), we typically do:
- 50% upfront
- 50% on completion

For retainer work:
- Monthly billing in advance

We can discuss custom arrangements for enterprise clients.

## Services

### What CMS do you recommend?

WordPress for 90% of business websites. It powers 43% of the web for good reasons: flexibility, SEO-friendliness, and massive ecosystem.

We use Bricks Builder or custom themes depending on project needs. No Elementor—it's too bloated.

For e-commerce: WooCommerce if you're on WordPress, Shopify if you want hosted simplicity.

### Do you do ongoing maintenance?

Yes. We offer monthly maintenance packages starting at $300/month that include:
- WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates
- Security monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Minor content updates
- Priority support

### What's included in SEO services?

Our SEO isn't just "optimizing pages." We cover:
- Technical audit and fixes
- Keyword strategy focused on revenue, not vanity
- On-page optimization
- Content strategy
- Link building (quality outreach, not spam)
- Monthly reporting on metrics that matter

Minimum 6-month commitment. SEO is a long game—anyone promising instant results is lying.

### Can you work with my existing website?

Usually yes. We can optimize, redesign, or rebuild depending on what's needed. Sometimes a rebuild is more cost-effective than fixing a broken foundation. We'll give you an honest assessment.

### Do you write content in languages other than English?

Our primary expertise is English content. For Hindi and other Indian languages, we have team members who can help. Other languages would require discussion.

### Do you do social media management?

Not as a standalone service. We create content and assets, but day-to-day posting and community management isn't our focus. We can recommend partners if needed.

## Technical Questions

### What makes your WordPress development different?

Three things:

1. **Performance obsession:** We optimize for sub-2-second load times. Most agency sites are slow. Ours aren't.

2. **Security-first:** Hardened configurations, regular updates, malware scanning included.

3. **Actually maintainable:** We don't use fragile page builders or over-customized themes. Your site should work for years, not months.

### Do you provide hosting?

We don't sell hosting directly, but we can manage hosting for you as part of a maintenance package. We typically recommend:
- **Budget:** Cloudways, SiteGround
- **Performance:** Kinsta, WP Engine
- **Cost-effective power:** Hetzner Cloud + CloudPanel (what we use ourselves)

### What's your tech stack?

- **CMS:** WordPress (primarily)
- **Builder:** Bricks, GenerateBlocks, or custom theme
- **Hosting:** Hetzner Cloud, Cloudways, or client's preferred
- **Performance:** FlyingPress or WP Rocket, Redis, CDN
- **Security:** Cloudflare, Wordfence, security hardening
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4, Search Console, custom dashboards

### Do you do custom development beyond WordPress?

Limited. Our strength is WordPress and the ecosystem around it. If you need a complex web application or non-WordPress solution, we can discuss, but it's not our core offering.

## Pricing & Contracts

### Why are you more expensive than other agencies?

Because we deliver more value. Our sites load faster, convert better, and don't break. We use senior people doing the actual work—not junior staff and offshore teams.

If you need the cheapest option, we're not it. If you need results that compound over time, we're worth the investment.

### Do you offer fixed-price or hourly billing?

Mostly fixed-price for projects. You should know what you're paying before we start.

Retainers are monthly fixed fees with defined scope.

Hourly is reserved for consulting, audits, or truly unpredictable work. We bill at $75-150/hour depending on the service.

### What's in your contracts?

Standard terms include:
- Detailed scope of work
- Payment schedule
- Timeline with milestones
- Revision policy (usually 2 rounds included)
- Intellectual property transfer on payment
- Termination clause
- Confidentiality

No legal tricks. We want the relationship to work for both sides.

### What if I'm not happy with the work?

We address concerns at milestones, not just at the end. If something's off, we fix it.

For fundamental scope disputes, we have a clear revision policy. If we've delivered what was agreed and you want something different, additional work is billed separately.

We've never had a project end badly because we communicate constantly. Surprises are the enemy.

### Do you require long-term contracts?

- **Projects:** No ongoing commitment. You pay for the project, we deliver it.
- **SEO:** 6-month minimum. SEO takes time—anyone offering month-to-month is either expensive or ineffective.
- **Maintenance:** Month-to-month after initial 3-month commitment.
- **Content:** Flexible—monthly, quarterly, or project-based.

## Communication & Process

### How often will we communicate during a project?

Weekly at minimum. Typically:
- Weekly status email or call
- Milestone check-ins with deliverables
- Slack/WhatsApp for quick questions (if you prefer)
- End-of-project review

We believe in proactive communication. You shouldn't have to chase us for updates.

### Who will I be working with?

For most projects, you'll work directly with Gaurav or a senior team lead. Not an account manager who relays messages to unknown developers.

You'll know who's doing your work, and you'll be able to talk to them.

### What do you need from me to get started?

Depends on the project, but typically:
- Access to existing website/hosting (if applicable)
- Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts)
- Content or content direction
- Examples of sites you like
- Clear business goals

We'll send a detailed onboarding questionnaire once we kick off.

### What if I don't have content ready?

We can write it (content marketing is a core service), or we can start with design using placeholder content and swap in final copy later.

That said, copy-first design is better. If you can get content ready before we start, do it.

---

## After the Project

### What happens after my website launches?

You get:
- 30 days of bug-fix support included
- Training session on how to use your site
- Documentation for your specific setup
- Option to continue with maintenance package

After 30 days, support is available via maintenance retainer or hourly as needed.

### Do I own the website/design/content?

Yes. Once paid in full, all deliverables are yours. We transfer all files, provide access to everything, and you can do whatever you want with it.

We don't hold work hostage. We don't charge "exit fees." Your stuff is your stuff.

### Can I hire you again for future work?

Of course. Most of our work comes from repeat clients and referrals. Once we've worked together, future projects are easier because we know your brand, preferences, and goals.
