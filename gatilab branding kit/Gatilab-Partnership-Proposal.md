## What We Need From Partners

### Clear Briefs
Detailed requirements, not vague directions. The better the brief, the better the outcome.

### Realistic Timelines
Don't promise your client next week if the work takes a month. We'll tell you what's realistic.

### Timely Feedback
Our timeline assumes prompt responses. Delayed feedback delays delivery.

### Fair Pricing to Clients
We price fairly. If you're marking up 5x, that's your business—but unrealistic expectations create problems.

### Honest Communication
If a project is going sideways on your end, tell us early. We can help, or at least adjust expectations.
