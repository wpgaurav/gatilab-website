## Inquiry Response Templates

### Template 1: General Inquiry Response

**Subject:** Re: Your Gatilab Inquiry — Let's Talk

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out.

You mentioned [brief summary of their need]. That's squarely in our wheelhouse.

A few quick questions to see if we're a fit:

1. What's driving this project? (New launch, rebrand, performance issues?)
2. What timeline are you working with?
3. Do you have a budget range in mind?

If easier, we can hop on a 20-minute call to discuss. Here's my calendar: [Link]

Looking forward to learning more.

### Template 2: Website Development Inquiry

**Subject:** Re: Website Development — Some Questions

Hi [Name],

Thanks for getting in touch about website development.

To give you an accurate estimate, I'd love to understand:

1. **Purpose:** What's the main goal of the site? (Lead generation, e-commerce, information?)
2. **Scope:** Rough idea of how many pages/features you need?
3. **Content:** Do you have content ready, or will you need help with that?
4. **Timeline:** Any hard deadlines?
5. **Budget:** What range are you targeting?

We typically work on projects starting at $3,500 for business sites. E-commerce and custom builds are scoped individually.

### Template 3: SEO Inquiry Response

**Subject:** Re: SEO Services — Let's Discuss

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in SEO.

Before we dive in, I have to be upfront: SEO isn't a quick fix. It takes 3-6 months to see significant results, and we require a 6-month minimum commitment. If you're looking for instant rankings, we're probably not the right fit.

If you're thinking long-term, here's what I'd need to know:

1. What's your current website? (URL)
2. What search terms do you want to rank for?
3. Have you done SEO work before? What happened?
4. What does success look like for you?

Our SEO retainers start at $800/month for local businesses and go up from there based on competition and goals.

Happy to chat more if this sounds aligned with what you need.

Best,
[Name]

### Template 4: Budget Mismatch (Polite Decline)

**Subject:** Re: Your Project

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the details on your project.

I have to be honest—based on what you've described, our pricing likely won't work for your budget. We start at [$X] for this type of project, and that's more than double what you mentioned.

A few alternatives worth considering:

- [Fiverr/Upwork for smaller budgets]
- [Template solutions like Squarespace or Wix]
- [Recommend specific alternative if you have one]

If your budget changes or you want to discuss a phased approach, my door's always open.

Best of luck with the project.

### Template 6: Proposal Accepted — Next Steps

**Subject:** Great News — Let's Get Started

Excited to move forward on [Project Name]!

Here's what happens next:

3. **Kickoff Questionnaire:** I'll send this once payment clears.

Looking forward to building this together.

### Template 7: Lost Deal Follow-up

**Subject:** Checking In

Hi [Name],

It's been a few weeks since we discussed [Project]. I'm guessing you've either moved forward with someone else or put the project on hold.

Either way, no hard feelings—just wanted to close the loop on my end.

If circumstances change, I'm here. And if there's feedback on why you went another direction, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing it.

Best of luck with everything.
