## Your Project Team

### Who You'll Work With

**Project Lead:** Your primary contact. They're responsible for your project's success and can answer any question.

**Specialists:** Depending on your project, you may interact with developers, designers, or content writers. But your project lead coordinates everything—you don't need to manage multiple people.

**Gaurav (Founder):** Available for strategic questions or if you need escalation. You have direct access.

### How to Reach Us

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Email | Updates, approvals, documentation | Within 24 hours |
| Slack/WhatsApp | Quick questions, urgent matters | Within 4 hours (business hours) |
| Scheduled Calls | Reviews, complex discussions | As scheduled |
| Phone | Emergencies only | Immediate |

We'll set up your preferred communication channel during kickoff.

## The Kickoff Questionnaire

Before our kickoff call, please complete the questionnaire we send. It covers:

### Business Context
- Your company and what you do
- Target audience and customers
- Business goals for this project
- How success will be measured

### Project Specifics
- What you need built/designed/created
- Examples of work you like (and don't like)
- Must-have features vs. nice-to-haves
- Content status (what exists, what needs creation)

### Logistics
- Key stakeholders and decision-makers
- Approval process for deliverables
- Timeline constraints or deadlines
- Any technical requirements or limitations

**Why this matters:** The better we understand your needs upfront, the less back-and-forth later. This questionnaire has saved our clients weeks of revision cycles.

**Our role:** Ask the right questions, document requirements, identify risks.

**Your role:** Review and approve the plan, provide input.

**Our role:** Develop strategy, present recommendations, incorporate feedback.

### Phase 3: Creation
The actual building—design, development, writing, or whatever your project requires.

**Your role:** Stay available for questions, provide assets as needed.

**Our role:** Execute the plan, share progress at milestones, maintain quality.

### Phase 4: Review & Revision

**Your role:** Thorough review, consolidated feedback, timely responses.

**Our role:** Implement changes, explain trade-offs, ensure satisfaction.

## Feedback & Revisions

### How to Give Great Feedback

**Be specific:** "The heading feels too corporate" is better than "I don't like it."

**Explain why:** "Our audience is young professionals, so the formal tone doesn't fit" helps us understand.

**Prioritize:** If you have 10 pieces of feedback, which 3 matter most?

**Consolidate:** Gather input from all stakeholders before sending. Contradictory feedback creates churn.

### Revision Policy

Most projects include two rounds of revisions. Here's what that means:

- **Round 1:** Major changes based on first review. New directions, structural changes, etc.
- **Round 2:** Minor refinements. Tweaks, polish, final adjustments.

Additional revision rounds are billed separately. But this rarely happens when feedback is clear and consolidated.

### What's Not a Revision

These are considered new scope (additional cost):
- Adding new pages or features not in original scope
- Changing direction after approval ("Actually, we want something completely different")
- Content changes after development begins
- Requests from stakeholders not involved in original brief

We'll always tell you before additional charges occur.

## Timeline Expectations

### Realistic Timelines

| Project Type | Typical Duration |
|--------------|------------------|

| Full Brand Identity | 3-4 weeks |
| Monthly SEO Retainer | Ongoing (results in 3-6 months) |
| Content Pieces | 5-7 business days each |

### What Affects Timeline

**Can extend timeline:**
- Delayed feedback (biggest factor)

- Multiple stakeholders with conflicting input

**Keeps timeline on track:**
- Quick, consolidated feedback
- Assets ready when needed
- Clear decision-making authority
- Scope discipline

### Rush Projects

Need it faster? Sometimes possible with rush fees. Talk to us early—last minute rushes are harder to accommodate.

## A Note From Gaurav

Thank you for trusting Gatilab with your project.

We take every engagement seriously. Your project isn't just another item in our queue—it's someone's business, someone's vision, someone's investment. We treat it that way.

A few things I believe:

**Communication prevents problems.** If something's unclear, ask. If something's wrong, tell us early. We'd rather over-communicate than miss something.

**Quality takes time.** We've scoped your project realistically. Rushing compromises results. Trust the process.

**We're partners, not vendors.** We'll push back if something doesn't make sense. We'll suggest better approaches. We're invested in your outcome, not just our deliverable.

Looking forward to building something great together.

— Gaurav Tiwari
Founder, Gatilab
