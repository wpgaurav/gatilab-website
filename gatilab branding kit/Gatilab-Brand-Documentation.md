Our mission isn't about vanity metrics. We don't chase pageviews or follower counts. We measure success by what matters: leads generated, sales closed, and businesses grown.

---

## 3. Core Values

### Conversion First

Every pixel, every word, every strategy has one job: drive results. We don't do pretty for pretty's sake. Design without purpose is decoration. Marketing without measurement is guesswork.

### Perfection Obsessed

Good enough isn't. We sweat the details others ignore—load times, mobile responsiveness, copy that actually persuades. Our clients notice the difference even when they can't articulate it.

### Quality Over Quantity

We'd rather do five projects exceptionally than fifty projects adequately. This isn't a limitation—it's a competitive advantage. Smaller client loads mean deeper attention.

### Client Partnership

We're not vendors waiting for instructions. We're partners invested in outcomes. Your success metrics are our success metrics. Your growth is how we measure our work.

### Transparency

No hidden fees. No vague deliverables. No promises we can't keep. We tell clients what's realistic, what's risky, and what's a waste of their money.

## 5. About Gatilab

### Long Version (200 words)

Gatilab is an independent digital marketing agency founded in 2014 by Gaurav Tiwari and Ravi Shahi, later joined by Siddharth Sharma as managing partner. Based in Delhi, we specialize in conversion-focused marketing, high-performance web development, and brand strategy.

Over the past decade, we've worked with 700+ clients globally—from startups finding their footing to enterprises like IBM, Adobe, HubSpot, Canva, and the Government of India. Our collective client portfolio has achieved 330% combined revenue growth, with Gatilab itself reporting 104% year-over-year growth.

What sets us apart is our obsession with outcomes. We don't measure success by deliverables completed—we measure it by results achieved. Every website we build is optimized for conversion. Every content strategy is designed for measurable ROI. Every SEO campaign is tracked against real business metrics.

Our team of 14+ specialists includes developers, designers, SEO architects, and content strategists who work collaboratively to deliver integrated solutions. We're not a factory churning out generic templates. We're craftspeople building custom solutions for clients who refuse to settle.

## 6. Unique Selling Propositions

### 1. Conversion-First Methodology

We don't start with design preferences. We start with business goals. What conversion rate do you need? What's your customer acquisition cost target? We reverse-engineer everything from there. This isn't decoration—it's growth engineering.

### 2. Enterprise Experience, Boutique Attention

We've worked with IBM, Adobe, HubSpot, and Government of India. We know what enterprise-level quality looks like. But we're not a factory. We maintain small enough client loads that every project gets senior attention.

### 3. Full-Stack Capability

Strategy, design, development, content, SEO—all under one roof. No handoffs between agencies. No "that's not our department." One team owning the entire outcome.

### 4. Measurable Outcomes

330% combined revenue growth across our client portfolio. 104% year-over-year agency growth. We track what matters and report what's real.

### 5. Technical Depth

Our founder is a WordPress core contributor with 16+ years of development experience. This isn't a marketing agency that outsources tech. We build our own tools, optimize our own code, and solve problems others can't.

---

## 7. Value Proposition

### For Startups

You need results fast, but you can't afford mistakes. We've helped startups establish their digital presence, build conversion-optimized websites, and create content strategies that punch above their weight. We know which battles to fight first and which to defer.

### For Growing Businesses

You've outgrown your DIY marketing. Now you need systems that scale. We build marketing infrastructure—websites, content engines, SEO foundations—that compound over time. Not quick fixes. Sustainable growth.

### For Enterprises

You have brand standards, compliance requirements, and stakeholders to satisfy. We've navigated enterprise complexity with clients like IBM, Adobe, and government agencies. We speak your language and deliver at your standards.

### For Marketing Agencies

You need a white-label partner who won't embarrass you. Our work has powered campaigns for agencies who needed development, design, or specialized SEO beyond their internal capabilities. Your clients never know we exist.

## 8. Brand Story

The name "Gatilab" combines "Gati" (momentum, progress in Hindi) with "Lab" (a place of experimentation and creation). It captures who we are: an agency that moves businesses forward through constant innovation.

Gatilab started in 2014 when Gaurav Tiwari, already a veteran WordPress developer and blogger, saw something broken in the marketing industry. Agencies were obsessed with awards and aesthetics but couldn't answer a simple question: "Did this actually grow the business?"

The answer was usually "we don't track that."

That was unacceptable.

So we built an agency on a different premise: every decision—from font choice to content strategy—should be traceable to business outcomes. Pretty websites that don't convert are failures. Viral content that doesn't build pipeline is noise.

A decade later, that founding philosophy hasn't changed. We've worked with over 700 clients, from solopreneurs to global brands. We've grown 104% year-over-year because our clients grow. Their success funds ours.

We've stayed deliberately lean. No endless account managers. No junior teams learning on client budgets. Senior people doing the actual work.

Is it scalable? Maybe not infinitely. But our clients don't need us to be big. They need us to be good.
