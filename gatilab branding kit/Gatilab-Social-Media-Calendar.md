## Content Pillars

All content should fall into one of these categories:

| Pillar | Purpose | % of Content |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Educational** | Teach marketing/design/dev skills | 40% |
| **Case Studies & Results** | Show what we've done | 25% |
| **Industry Opinions** | Take stances on trends | 20% |
| **Behind-the-Scenes** | Show how we work | 10% |
| **Promotional** | Direct service mentions | 5% |

Note: Promotional content is only 5%. We earn attention by being useful, not by pitching constantly.

## Weekly Content Schedule

### Monday — Educational
Start the week with value. Teach something actionable.

**Post Types:**
- How-to tutorials
- Tool recommendations
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Quick tips with examples

**Example:**
> "Your WordPress site is slow because of three things: bad hosting, unoptimized images, and too many plugins. Here's how to diagnose which one is killing your performance..."

### Tuesday — Case Study / Results
Show, don't tell. Share real outcomes.

**Post Types:**
- Before/after metrics
- Project walkthroughs
- Client wins (anonymized if needed)
- Lessons from recent work

**Example:**
> "Client's load time: 4.2s → 0.9s

### Wednesday — Industry Opinion
Take a stance. Be interesting, not safe.

**Post Types:**
- Hot takes on trends
- Contrarian views with reasoning
- Industry predictions
- Analysis of common practices

**Example:**
> "Unpopular opinion: Most SEO audits are useless.
> 
> They find 200 'issues' and prioritize none of them.
> 
> What actually moves rankings: fix site speed, create better content than competitors, get links from real sites.
> 
> Everything else is noise."

---

### Thursday — Educational (Deep Dive)
Longer-form educational content.

**Post Types:**
- Multi-step processes
- Detailed explanations
- Framework shares
- Resource compilations

**Example:**
> "The 5-step website brief that prevents scope creep:
> 
> 1. Define success metrics (not 'looks good')
> 2. List must-have pages with purpose
> 3. Identify content status (have it / need it / will write it)
> 4. Set timeline with buffer
> 5. Name decision-makers
> 
> Template in comments."

---

### Friday — Behind-the-Scenes
Show the human side. Build connection.

**Post Types:**
- How we approach problems
- Team highlights
- Work process reveals
- Tool stack shares

**Example:**
> "Our project kickoff checklist:
> 
> ☐ Goals documented (not assumed)
> ☐ Timeline agreed in writing
> ☐ All assets received
> ☐ Access to existing systems
> ☐ Decision-maker identified
> 
> Sounds basic. Skipping any of these has cost us weeks."

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### LinkedIn

**Primary platform for B2B reach.**

**Best practices:**
- Start with a hook (problem or surprising statement)
- Use line breaks for readability
- 1,300 characters is the cutoff before "see more"

- Post 10-11am IST for Indian audience, or match target timezone

**Content types that work:**
- Personal stories with business lessons
- Step-by-step processes
- Contrarian opinions with reasoning

**Avoid:**
- Generic motivational content
- Engagement bait ("Comment 'YES' if...")
- Corporate speak
- Posts without substance

---

### Twitter/X

**For quick insights and personality.**

**Best practices:**
- Lead with the insight, not context
- Threads for longer content (5-10 tweets max)
- Use plain language
- Engage with replies

**Content types:**
- Quick tips
- Industry commentary
- Threads breaking down processes
- Sharing interesting resources

**Avoid:**
- Over-promotion
- Arguing with trolls
- Posting without value

### Instagram

**Lower priority for B2B, but useful for brand.**

**Best practices:**
- Carousel posts for educational content

- [ ] Is there unnecessary jargon?
- [ ] Am I saying something or just posting to post?

## What Success Looks Like

We don't chase vanity metrics. Success is:

- **Inbound inquiries** from people who already trust us
- **Quality conversations** that lead to fit assessments
- **Referrals** because our content got shared
- **Authority** in our niche topics

Not:
- Follower count
- Viral posts
- Engagement from non-buyers
